## Communicating ideas in the most timeless and universal ways possible.

Rúben Rodrigues \(1997, Leiria\) is a Portuguese designer and holds a degree in Design \(2018\) from IADE - Universidade Europeia.

Since 2015 he has been doing some freelance work focused on identity design. In 2018 he participated in the Navigator Dreams Realm Contest and won the best entry of his university, in a parallel contest organized by IADE and McCann.

He has been in love with art and design since the first day he picked up a pencil. Constantly drawing, doodling and making things, he eventually discovered the computer and began his passion for the digital and the graphic world.

While he spends most of his days on the computer, he is passionate about finding inspiration from other great artists and designers. Recently he has been into the work of Brian Collins, Massimo Vignelli, Corita Kent and Hey Studio.
