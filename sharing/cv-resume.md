For me, design is dealing with situations at a precise moment or in a time interval. I’m not a big fan of the mythical “solving problems”. If we solve them why do we keep redesign identities, cars, products, etc? Perhaps we have popularized this quick answer for when we are asked what design is ...

I do believe in the methods and approaches we take in order to minimize a possible new problem.  
 As designers we work a lot in unfamiliar territories where most people are not synthesized, and the way we look at a problem, the questions we ask, the systems we create \(whether it’s an identity, a sign, a poster, anything\), allows us to help people understand something.

As Massimo Vignelli said, the life of a designer is a life of struggle, the struggle against bad design. And there is a lot of bad design around this world.  
I will always try to fight it with 3 essential things in mind: My design must be simple, memorable and long lasting.
