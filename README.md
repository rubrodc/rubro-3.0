## Why I started this?

The best way to truly understand anything is to use the generation effect: to produce your own content, in your own words, and to share it with the world to create a feedback loop.

## My wiki workflow

I'm writing most on my notes in markdown using [Atom](https://atom.io/). Why did I choose markdown? Simplicity and focusing on what matters. I don't lose time on visual stuff, changing colors, making notes pop out, bla bla bla...

Why Atom? I love it because you can work with Git and GitHub directly from Atom with the GitHub package, so I just open the main folder and everytime I take notes I pull them up to GitHub instantly.

To search my notes I'm using [ueli](https://ueli.app/). I've configured it to only search files on that specific folder, so when I press `Opt+Spacebar` a searchbar instantly pops up and I just type what I'm looking for.
