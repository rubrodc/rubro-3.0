## This is an extension of me â€” thoughts, ideas, patterns, rules-of-thumb, tools, cheatsheets, leverage points, questions, risks, and unknowns. All combined to make a better version of myself.

> Everyone has a story; no one is going to tell it but you.

Based on digital garden, personal knowledge management, exobrain, brain dump...

You can read more [about me](everything-i-know/sharing/about-me.md) and find me on [social media](everything-i-know/social-media/).

If you are still confused, [Josh Buchea](https://joshbuchea.com/whats-a-digital-garden/) has some nice explanations on his digital garden about what this is, go take a look ðŸ‘€

## Why I started this?

The best way to truly understand anything is to use the generation effect: to produce your own content, in your own words, and to share it with the world to create a feedback loop.

## My wiki workflow

I'm writing most on my notes in markdown using [Atom](https://atom.io/). Why did I choose markdown? Simplicity and focusing on what matters. I don't lose time on visual stuff, changing colors, making notes pop out, bla bla bla...

Why Atom? I love it because you can work with Git and GitHub directly from Atom with the GitHub package, so I just open the main folder and everytime I take notes I pull them up to GitHub instantly.

To search my notes I'm using [ueli](https://ueli.app/). I've configured it to only search files on that specific folder, so when I press `Opt+Spacebar` a searchbar instantly pops up and I just type what I'm looking for.
