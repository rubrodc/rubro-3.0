## Notes

### What makes a great logo & Iconic?

1. Appropriate in the feeling
2. Distinctive and memorable
3. Simple

A logo is not communication - IS IDENTIFICATION &gt; doodle test

If the client doesn’t understand, show them what other companies are doing.

Hey look at this companies and their identities. The bigger the company, simpler the logo.

“We are independent because we care about good design”

* Organizações, ativistas e cenas relacionadas em que acreditamos na visão deles e que gostaríamos de os ajudar.

How to set prices?

1. Is this a good client that will allow us to create?
2. Is it gonna be very visible?
3. Is this a very difficult design problem?

Feeling and Guts

Slap on the logo is the best compliment you can give to a logo because it will work on different scenarios.

Slap the logo everywhere because the logo is not to use only in white paper.

The logo is our baby born and we gonna pass him to the clients not knowing where it will be used, so we need to take care of that

This logo should last for “x” years so you can divide that price for the number of years and doesn’t sound so high anymore

Start the presentation with the some advices.

1. Is not always love at first sight
2. Logo is not about what you like or dislike
3. It reminds me of bla, bla, bla

We never put the pencil on paper before hearing the client.

At first we try to be like a sponge and absorve everything we can so we could enter their world.

Things about their competition, vision, mission, who they are? who they want to be? who might they be in the future?

We need to meetup the CEO at first. We can’t just meet him on the logo presentation day and show them designs and shapes we never saw.

We need to hear him and he needs to trust us, so when we go back and we do recommendations he can listen to us.
