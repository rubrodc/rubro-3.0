## Content Structure

1. Title
2. Description - My thoughts on the topic.
3. Subtopics - Various subtopics related to the main topic.
4. Notes - My own personal notes on the matter as well as things I found interesting on the internet regarding the topic. I often give a link of where I got things from.
5. Links - Links related to the topic.

The structure of each of the posts will often look roughly like this:

Each topic will have a title, some description of it, usually my own thoughts and knowledge on it as well as referencing some resources or links I have liked or used that helped me either understand the topic or gain appreciation of it.
