Non-fungible token

Non-fungible tokens are used to create verifiable\[[how?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)\] [artificial scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_scarcity) in the digital domain, as well as digital ownership, and the possibility of asset interoperability across multiple platforms.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token#cite_note-4) NFTs are used in several specific applications that require unique digital items like [crypto art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_art), digital [collectibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectable), and [online gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_game).

> “If something exists only in digital form — i.e. a gif, a meme, a digital image, a digital video — it is easy to simply screen shot, copy or paste it, or replicate it. A digital artwork’s value is diminished when it comes to selling it commercially because it is so easy to copy — and difficult to track what is, in fact, the original artwork.” - Blake Finucane
