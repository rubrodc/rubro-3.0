Non-fungible token

Non-fungible tokens are used to create verifiable\[[how?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)\] [artificial scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_scarcity) in the digital domain, as well as digital ownership, and the possibility of asset interoperability across multiple platforms.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token#cite_note-4) NFTs are used in several specific applications that require unique digital items like [crypto art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_art), digital [collectibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectable), and [online gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_game).

> ‚ÄúIf something exists only in digital form ‚Äî i.e. a gif, a meme, a digital image, a digital video ‚Äî it is easy to simply screen shot, copy or paste it, or replicate it. A digital artwork‚Äôs value is diminished when it comes to selling it commercially because it is so easy to copy ‚Äî and difficult to track what is, in fact, the original artwork.‚Äù - Blake Finucane
