> under development. I'm still trying to find a system that works for me. So far I got this.

## Notes

### Rules for better naming files

1. Do not use cryptic codes that only YOU understand. Make it mean something to everyone else. \(bad example: prj12â€“1spl.doc\)
2. Keep names as short as possible by using common abbreviations, such as Jan for January or Corp for Corporation.
3. Use descriptive information and include dates in files names if possible. We should know whatâ€™s in the file without having to open it \(bad example: document.pdf\)
4. Reference company name\(s\) within file. If you are sending a contract to a company make sure that your company and the other company are in the file name.
5. Avoid special characters all together \(like ~ ! @ \# $ %, etc\). Characters such as / ? &lt; &gt;  : \* \| â€œ ^ are also prohibited in file or folder names. The only exception to this rule is the ampersand â€˜&â€™. This is okay because all systems accept this and many company names contain an â€˜&â€™.
6. Spaces are acceptable.
7. Do not exceed 260 characters for total folder & file character count. C:\Users\Panda\My Documents\Dropbox\Creative Nonfiction\My Autobiography\Favorite Things\Favorite Foods\Bamboo\Family Recipes\Fresh Leaves.doc \(142 characters\)
8. Use sequential numbering \(01, 02, etc instead of 1, 2, etc\)
9. Use Title Casing \(Capital first letter of every word\)
10. User version numbers if files will have multiple iterations \(V1, V2, V2.1\)

### Folder Structure

WORK -CLIENT FOLDER --PROJECT FOLDER ---CLIENT INPUT - stuff the client sends to me ---BUSINESS - quotes, schedules, proposals, etc ---ASSETS - images, icons, design elements ---DESIGN - the work per se ---PRODUCTION - final stuff my client needs

### My File Name Convention

All files which have a relation to a specific day or a point in time are prefixed with a date-stamp or according to an adopted [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. Additionally, starting a file name with such a date/time-stamp ensures that files are displayed in temporal order.

`yymmdd_client_name of the file_size.extension`

Examples

* `210311_rdc_PalmTrees_1080x1080.ai`
* `180703_projectname_sd_descriptionModel_04`
* `180819_rubro_sd_logo_01.sketch`

**abbreviations**

* sd - schematic design
* cc - concept
* wp - work in progress
* v1 - version 1,2,3â€¦
* da - Data Analysis
* v - Version
* p - poster
* s - sticker
* e - Experiment
* PM â€“ Project management
* TRG â€“ Training
* HR â€“ Human Resources
* SEC â€“ Security / Risk Management
* LEG â€“ Legal
* VEH â€“ Vehicle Fleet Mgt
* LOG â€“ Logistics
* ITC â€“ Information & Communications Technology
* PRO â€“ Procurement
* FIN â€“ Finance
* FAC â€“ Facilities Management

Others:

* Beta = Development stage \(Alpha, Beta, Released\)
* 19 = Version of the dev stage \(B17, B18, B19\)
* 4 = Hotfix of the version \(B19.3 was the third hotfix of B19\)
* 1 = Version of the hotfix \(B19.4.0 is the version 0 of the hotfix 4\)
* 43 = Build Number \(allow the dev to know exactly under which parameters the game is\)

So Beta 19.4.1.43 = Version 19 of the Beta, hotfix 4 version 1, Build 43
