# ðŸ”¤ Abbreviations

This is a list of some abbreviations I've come across.

Some types of abbreviations are [acronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym) \(which are pronounceable\), [initialisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialism) \(using initials only\), or grammatical [contractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_%28grammar%29) or [crasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crasis).

An abbreviation is a shortening by any of these, or other, methods.
