## Questions to ask recruiters
from [Landing.Jobs Newsletter](https://landing.jobs/home)

- 🤝 "How is the recruitment process?" - When you’re in the early stages of the process, wanting to know more about what’s to come is sort of the “Interviewing for Dummies” rule no.1.
- 📈 "What does success look like in this role and how do you measure it?" -  Yes, be the person who asks this to the recruiter. Show that you really want to have a real understanding of the position’s KPIs and how they’re measured. You’re definitely going to look smart and interested, and trust us, the answer is going to give you a lot of useful insights.
- 🧡 "What’s your favorite part about working in the company?" - Not everything has to be about you. Ask about the other person sitting in front of you (or on the other side of the screen 👨‍💻), get a good conversation flowing. It’ll catch them off-guard in a good way.
- 🚀 "What are the career progression opportunities?" - Ambition never hurt anybody. Letting the other person know that you take ownership of your career is awesome.
