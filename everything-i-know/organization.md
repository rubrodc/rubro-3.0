### My File Name Convention

> under development. I'm still trying to find a system that works for me. So far I got this.

All files which have a relation to a specific day or a point in time are prefixed with a date-stamp or according to an adopted [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. Additionally, starting a file name with such a date/time-stamp ensures that files are displayed in temporal order.

`yymmdd-who made it-type of product-name of the file-size.extension`

so you get something like

`210311-rdc-p-palm trees-1080x1080.ai`


type of product

\(P\)oster

\(S\)ticker

`YYYY-MM-DD - CompanyName - Description`

An example for a received invoice it would look like this:

`2020-04-28 - Netflix - Invoice for March 2020.pdf`

Quite clear IMO:

* Beta =&gt; Development stage \(Alpha, Beta, Released\)
* 19 =&gt; Version of the dev stage \(B17, B18, B19\)
* 4 =&gt; Hotfix of the version \(B19.3 was the third hotfix of B19\)
* 1 =&gt; Version of the hotfix \(B19.4.0 is the version 0 of the hotfix 4\)
* 43 =&gt; Build Number \(allow the dev to know exactly under which parameters the game is\)

So Beta 19.4.1.43 = Version 19 of the Beta, hotfix 4 version 1, Build 43

PRODUCT SERIAL CODE
