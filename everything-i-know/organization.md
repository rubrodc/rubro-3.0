`YYYY-MM-DD - CompanyName - Description`

An example for a received invoice it would look like this:

`2020-04-28 - Netflix - Invoice for March 2020.pdf`

Quite clear IMO:

* Beta =&gt; Development stage \(Alpha, Beta, Released\)
* 19 =&gt; Version of the dev stage \(B17, B18, B19\)
* 4 =&gt; Hotfix of the version \(B19.3 was the third hotfix of B19\)
* 1 =&gt; Version of the hotfix \(B19.4.0 is the version 0 of the hotfix 4\)
* 43 =&gt; Build Number \(allow the dev to know exactly under which parameters the game is\)

So Beta 19.4.1.43 = Version 19 of the Beta, hotfix 4 version 1, Build 43
