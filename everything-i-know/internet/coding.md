### Hierarchy for CSS

1. _positional formatting_ such as `display`, `position` ... because this can affect the layout greatly
2. _layout_ such as `margin` or `padding` ... same as above
3. _sizing_ such as `width`, `height` or `font-size` ... this has the ability to affect layout.
4. _color_ and _text formatting_ such as `color`, `background-color`, `letter-spacing` or `text-transform`
