## Notes

Lost ideas from college time. I had a fashion course too ;\)   
Below are some concepts and key ideas from my college essays.

#### Sportswear

* Fashion can gain several ‚Äúramifications‚Äù from a single style
* You can't dress just because it's fashionable, you have to match also with the person and his attitude towards society.
* Everything evolves, mainly the manufacturing materials and technologies.
* In the 1960s, nobody wore tennis shoes. The sneakers were only to be used on special occasions and for playing sports.

#### Electronic Music

* Fashion is also linked to a type of people who identify with a certain movement, feeling or cult;
* Many elements and accessories that were once in fashion reappear, but with a different approach, whether it be recycling or giving a new meaning;
* Today fashion is not so linear and everyone can wear what they want;
* Color, Drugs, Psychedelics, Movements, Groups, Party, Fun, Technology, Music, Change of the millennium.

#### Militarism

* Fashion has no or does not need to have tangible and objective justifications. It looks beautiful and ready.
* What is worn by someone can become an icon and become everyone's desire.
* The fashion around militarism conveys strength, robustness and protection
* Sometimes fashion is born out of people's needs.
* Art can also influence fashion.
* Fashion is susceptible to beliefs, religions and cultures.
