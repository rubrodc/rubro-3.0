#  Tokenomics

# Category of crypticurrencies
The biggest differentiation between the two is that cryptocurrencies have their own blockchains, whereas crypto tokens are built on an existing blockchain.

## Coins
Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Solana (SOL), Terra (LUNA)

## **Tokens**
The token is a non-native blockchain asset and its value goes beyond only monetary functions. Tokens also require another platform to exist and operate. 
For example, ETH is a cryptocurrency that is native to the Ethereum blockchain, which makes it a coin. However, one of the primary features of the Ethereum network is the ability to create new tokens within the network. The cryptocurrencies that are created on this network will be called tokens. For example, USDT — the most popular stablecoin pegged to the value of $USD is a token, which operates on the Ethereum blockchain.

Chainlink LINK (ETH), Shiba Inu SHIB (ETH), The Sandbox SAND (ETH), Basic Attention Token BAT (ETH), 1inch Network 1INCH (ETH), PancakeSwap CAKE (BNB Smart Chain (BEP20))

### Token Types
**1. Payment Tokens**

**2. Utility Tokens**
Utility tokens are a popular type of fungible tokens that you can think of as the chips at the casino. In the same way that you need to buy chips to play blackjack or poker, you need utility tokens to power the operations on the protocol.  
  
The most famous utility token example is Ether which powers all the transactions and smart contracts on the [Ethereum](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/) network. As we just said before, ETH can be used as a means of payment, however, its primary purpose is to be utilized in the blockchain.  
  
Social Tokens (fan tokens):Social tokens can be a very interesting type of crypto utility asset that recently gained a lot of popularity among the crypto space and also presented the concept of tokenization to the broader public. In simple words, social tokens are backed by the reputation of an individual, brand, sports club, or just any community

**Community Investment Wallet**
Our community investment wallet will invest the funds allocated to the wallet, into new projects, NFT, or whatever the community decides! Our wallet will have real-time audit in our dashboard

**Redistribution to holders**
HODL. our HODL’ers need to be rewarded and bots or other speculators should be punished. therefore you need to hold your coins for at least 24 hours, to benefit from the redistribution.

**Burned**
At each transaction, a percentage of that transaction will be burned. this decreases the total token supply, making the tokens more scarce.

**Liquidity**
In order to ensure that $DCIP can be exchanged on Pancakeswap, each transaction will have a percentage that directly flows back to the liquidity on Pancakeswap.

**Marketing wallet**
$DCIP will use marketing at its best. with the use of (Crypto) Influencers, Social media campaigns, and even traditional ways of marketing (advertisements, billboards, and sponsored articles) we will make sure “the word goes out”.
